Determining the cost of a rocket launch, focusing on SpaceX and their ability to reuse the first stage of their rockets

We know that the first stage is larger and more expensive than the second stage, and it plays a crucial role in getting the rocket off the ground. SpaceX has achieved success in landing and reusing the first stage in some cases, but there are instances where it cannot be recovered.

Our objective is to determine the price of each launch. To accomplish this, we gather information about SpaceX and create dashboards to analyze the data. Rather than relying on traditional rocket science methods, we employ machine learning to predict whether the first stage will land successfully. This prediction enables us to estimate the cost of a launch.
